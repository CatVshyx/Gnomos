# Gnomos
an application for sharing your news  in your daily life!

To start using an app you need a downloaded  mySQL server(the app works only with it)
Before starting an app , go into config.properties where you fill the gaps (i mean , username , url, password and database name which you will use )
Be careful , just connect your database - tables will be created programmatically and there will be some accounts already.


Features:
  You can sign up and sign in in app and become a new member of gnomos community
  You can post news and your daily routine 
  There in gnomos you can find new friends and "follow" them (read their posts)
  You can configure your profile: change your image , nickname email and so on and your friends will see it immeditiately 


app doesnt work until the server is configured
